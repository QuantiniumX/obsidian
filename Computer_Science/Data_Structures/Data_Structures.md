A **data structure** is a data organization, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data.More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data,i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data. 

Therefore A data structure is:
1. Stores Data
2. Organizes data in such a way that it is easy to access and modify it quickly.
3. Implements algorithmic functions that expose the ability to read and modify the data.

## Types of Data Structures
- Array
- Linked List
- Record / Tuple
- Hash Table
- Graphs
- Stacks
- Queues
- Tree
