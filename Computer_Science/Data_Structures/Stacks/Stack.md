> A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle, where the last element added to the structure is the first one to be removed. It operates on the principle of two main operations: push, which adds an element to the top of the stack, and pop, which removes the top element from the stack.

The basic concept can be illustrated by thinking of your data set as a **stack of plates or books** where you can only take the top item of the stack in order to remove things from it.
