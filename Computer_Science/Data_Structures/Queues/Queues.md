> A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle, where the first element added to the structure is the first one to be removed. It operates on the principle of two main operations: enqueue, which adds an element to the back of the queue, and dequeue, which removes the front element from the queue.
