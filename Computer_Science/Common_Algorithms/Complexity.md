Runtime refer to the performance of the algorithm as the input size grow. It can be denoted by **Big O**. 

Given below is the list of common algorithmic runtimes. The runtimes are listed in ascending order of their complexity.

- **O(1)** - Constant
- **O(log n)** - Logarithmic
- **O(n)** - Linear
- **O(n log n)** - Linearithmic
- **O(n^2)** - Quadratic
- **O(n^3)** - Cubic
- **O(2^n)** - Exponential
- **O(n!)** - Factorial
- **O(n^k)** - Polynomial
