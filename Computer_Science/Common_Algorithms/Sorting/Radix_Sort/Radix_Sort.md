Radix Sort sorts the elements by processing them digit by digit.

Radix Sort is really cool as it can be applied on data that can be sorted lexicographically i.e. it can sort integers, words, punch cards or the mail.


## Analysis
### Time Complexity
- O(d * (n + b)), where d is the number of digits, n is the number of elements, and b is the base of the number system being used.
### Space Complexity
- O(n + b), where n is the number of elements and b is the base of the number system.
