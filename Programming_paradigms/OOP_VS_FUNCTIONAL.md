# ESSENCE OF OOP
OOP is all about grouping data and behavior together in one place. They tend to think it in form of a body that can do stuff. The body is defined as an object and the stuff it can do is defined as methods.
```
"How can I write a Human class that holds data about the human and simulate the behavior of the human."
```

# ESSENCE OF FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
Functional bros tend to think of their code in form of input and output and how these inputs and output transition the world from one state to another.
```
"When the human takes a step. What's the next state or position of the human."
```

## Classes VS Functions

- Classes encourage to think about the world as hierarchical collection of objects. Objects bundle together in a way that draws boundaries between instances of things.
- Functions encourage you to think the world as a series of transformation on data. Functions take data as input, transform it and return an output. 

**My Take Functional is better.**
