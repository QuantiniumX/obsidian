The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of algorithms, data structures, and other components that can be used to simplify the development of C++ programs. The STL provides a range of containers, such as vectors, lists, and maps, as well as algorithms for searching, sorting and manipulating data.

### Some of the key components of the STL include:
1. Containers: The STL provides a range of containers, such as vector, list, map, set, and stack, which can be used to store and manipulate data.
2. Algorithms: The STL provides a range of algorithms, such as sort, find, and binary_search, which can be used to manipulate data stored in containers.
3. Iterators: Iterators are objects that provide a way to traverse the elements of a container. The STL provides a range of iterators, such as forward_iterator, bidirectional_iterator, and random_access_iterator, that can be used with different types of containers.
4. Function Objects: Function objects, also known as functors, are objects that can be used as function arguments to algorithms. They provide a way to pass a function to an algorithm, allowing you to customize its behavior.
5. Adapters: Adapters are components that modify the behavior of other components in the STL. For example, the reverse_iterator adapter can be used to reverse the order of elements in a container.
