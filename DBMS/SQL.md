Structured Query Language, or [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) is the primary language used to manage and interact with [Relational Database](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-a-relational-database?hl=en). We can use SQL to do various operations such as creating database and table, updating, searching, reading and deleting.
